                <li>Sugar facilitates sharing and collaboration: Children can write,
  share books, or make music together with a single mouse-click.</li>
  <li>Activities, not applications: Sugar activities are applicable
  beyond the scope of the classroom and even Sugar itself.</li>
  <li>Automatic backup of Activity work; no worrying about files or
  folders. Sugar’s Journal makes it almost impossible to lose any
  data.</li>
  <li>The Journal records everything you do: It is a place to reflect
  upon and evaluate your work.</li>
  <li>Sugar runs on most computer hardware, including slower machines.</li>
  <li>Sugar is Free (Libre) Software: It is written in the Python
  language and easily customized.</li>
  <li>Sugar is documented by its users: It is easy to use and teachers
  worldwide have created a wealth of pedagogical materials for it.</li>
  <li>Sugar is written by its users: 50% of the updates to our latest
  release came directly from our users.</li>

                <li>At Sugar Labs, we strive for a “learning-centric” approach, where
teachers mentor students as they engage with powerful ideas, “teaching
less and learning more.” While we want to give children access to
knowledge—through media such as electronic books, the world-wide web,
and multimedia—we also want them to acquire this knowledge by putting
it to use and engaging in critical dialog. With Sugar, we help
learners acquire knowledge by giving them tools that make them
consumers, critics, and creators of knowledge; Sugar welcomes them as
members of a learning community. Cross-community collaboration between
technologists and teachers ensures that the ideals of freedom,
sharing, open critique, and transparency will be part of the interface
to learning that touches children in the world’s classrooms.</li>
