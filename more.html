  <li class="price">At Sugar Labs, we strive for a “learning-centric” approach, where
teachers mentor students as they engage with powerful ideas, “teaching
less and learning more.” While we want to give children access to
knowledge—through media such as electronic books, the world-wide web,
and multimedia—we also want them to acquire this knowledge by putting
it to use and engaging in critical dialog. With Sugar, we help
learners acquire knowledge by giving them tools that make them
consumers, critics, and creators of knowledge; Sugar welcomes them as
members of a learning community. Cross-community collaboration between
technologists and teachers ensures that the ideals of freedom,
sharing, open critique, and transparency will be part of the interface
to learning that touches children in the world’s classrooms.</li>

  <li class="price">The Sugar pedagogy is embodied in the culture of Free/Libre
Software; teachers and students are empowered with both the freedom to
act and the freedom to be critical. Criticism of ideas is a powerful
force in learning and in fostering economic development; unleashing
that is an important part of the mission.</li>
