##What makes this design more attractive?

This design supports responsive design which enables a more structured design frameo ultimately leading to an attractive view.

Appropriate spacing between ui elements helps in avoiding cluttering of elements.

The ui components design, animations and transitions present help to make the website more lively and interactive.

Proper sizes of elements helps in producing a striking appearance.

The fonts and icons used are user friendly and enhance the look of the website.

The colours used are very restricted which produces a simple,generic and elegant color theme.

The appropriate background images allows display a pleasant view.

##What makes this design easier to explore?

This design concentrates on being more of a single-page web application(not completely) so most of the content is available in the index page itself. 

For this kind of design to be used more efficiently, it has been divided into sections and each of sections have been allocated headings which represents what the sections represent and are represented as titles in each section.

The above headings have been pinned to the navigation bar which allows the users to understand what the sections actually represent as they scroll through the website.

Each of the sections have been structured into appropriate sizes(apart from few) where each section size is less than or equal to a browser window size to make sure that it reduces the load on the users of having to scroll up/down to view the whole section.

There is also a small up-arrow at the bottom right corner which helps users to get back to the top of the page so that the user is brought back to the top automatically  instead of a manual top scrolling.

The navigation bar is responsive to the user scrolling and guides the user by informing which section the user is currently in by underlining the section heading in the navigation bar.

Headers in the navigation bar helps to guide the user to the appropriate section by going to the header-related section automatically when a header is tapped in the navigation bar.

The responsive design allows for a hassle-free exploration of the website for both web and mobile platforms.

This website is created using Jekyll, Bootstrap, some plugins and pure jQuery.

Suggestions are welcome!

Install Ruby and the Gem package manager (pre-installed in Mac OS X) and install `jekyll` and its related packages available in the Github hosted version by running, from this directory:

    bundle install;

Jekyll can run a local web server that rebuilds each time you save a page while editing:

    jekyll serve --incremental;

Then open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
