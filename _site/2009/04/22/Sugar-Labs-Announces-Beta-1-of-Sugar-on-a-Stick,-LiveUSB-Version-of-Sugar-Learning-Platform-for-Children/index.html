<p>Cambridge, MA, April 22, 2009: Sugar Labs™ announces the availability for
testing of Sugar on a Stick Beta‑1. This version of the free open-source Sugar
Learning Platform, available at <a href="http://www.sugarlabs.org">www.sugarlabs.org</a>
for loading on any 1 Gb or greater USB stick, is designed to facilitate
exploration of the award-winning Sugar interface beyond its original platform,
the One Laptop per Child XO‑1, to such varied hardware as aging PCs and recent
Macs to the latest netbooks.</p>

<p>Teachers and parents interested in trying Sugar with children can download the
Sugar on a Stick beta‑1 file from the Sugar Labs website and load it onto a
USB stick by following the instructions at <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick">wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_S
tick</a>.</p>

<p>Walter Bender, Executive Director of Sugar Labs, said “Sugar is perfectly
suited for children in the classroom with its simple, colorful interface,
built-in collaboration, and open architecture. Sugar on a Stick lets you start
a computer with Sugar and store a child’s data on the stick without touching
the host computer’s hard disk. Sugar’s Activities such as Write, a shared word
processor, and the recently announced InfoSlicer Activity, which enables
teachers to easily collect and package web-based content for the classroom,
benefit fully from Sugar’s collaboration features.”</p>

<p>Caroline Meeks of Solution Grove
(<a href="http://www.solutiongrove.com">www.solutiongrove.com</a>), the Sugar on a Stick
project manager, commented: “We’re counting on teachers to help us improve
Sugar on a Stick as we work towards our Version‑1 release scheduled for Q3</p>
<ol>
  <li>We just presented Sugar on a Stick at the FOSS VT conference
(<a href="http://www.ncose.org/node/47">http://www.ncose.org/node/47</a>) where it generated great interest, and our
real-world tests at local sites with varied aging PCs have been very
encouraging.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Sugar testers are invited to send bug information and constructive criticism
to <a href="mailto:feedback@sugarlabs.org">feedback@sugarlabs.org</a>. “We won’t be able
to reply to every message,” continued Ms. Meeks, “but we will read every one
in order to make Sugar on a Stick a reliable learning tool in budget-stretched
classrooms by the fall.”</p>
